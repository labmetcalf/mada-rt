# Estimating R<sub>t</sub> for Covid-19 in Madagascar

Here we estimate the time varying effective reproductive number of R<sub>t</sub> for Covid-19 in Madagascar. 

## Methods

We use the methods described in [Abbott et al](link) and the R packages EpiNow and EpiSoon to generate estimates for Rt 

Briefly:
- This uses a delay distribution from here
- incubation period distribution frome here
- a serial interval distribution from here. 

This method accounts for:
- 
- 
- 

This does not account for:
- 
- 
-

See here for an application globally including.
